# Homework-Week-11

I liked this weeks project.  The concept of Parallax scrolling was interesting to me.  It makes for a more
modern concept and design of the site. I chose the Universe as my subject to tie in with the moderization that
I think this brings.  I started thinking I would do a super hero picture to go along with the Hero Image concept
but with the images I chose it did not seem to fit right, so I started over searching for a diffirent topic
that would flow better with the moder style of the page.
My Github Windows is still uploading slow to the site, Im gussing its the amount of changes and the size
of the images.  It has been over 30min in some of the updates and still not showing on the website.
Also I feel that my images dont have the deffinition on my page that they did when I viewed them as seprate images.
Not sure if its in the display paramaters or just in my laptops ability.
